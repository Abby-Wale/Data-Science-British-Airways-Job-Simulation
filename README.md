## Project Description
This project involves web scraping to collect data for a data science job simulation for British Airways. The data collected is then used for sentiment analysis. The project also includes a predictive model for customer behaviour.

## Installation
The project uses several Python libraries. To install these libraries, use the commands in the code. 
Additionally, the project uses the BeautifulSoup library for web scraping. You can install it using the following command:

```python
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

The project also uses the Requests library to make HTTP requests. You can install it using the following command:

```python
pip install requests
```

## Usage
The project involves scraping data from the British Airways reviews page. The data collected includes the reviewer's name, general rating, comment header, comment body, aircraft type, type of traveller, type of seat, route type, date flown, seat comfort rating, wifi and connectivity rating, cabin staff service rating, food and beverages rating, and recommendation status. 
The project also includes a predictive model for customer behaviour. The model uses the collected data to predict future customer behaviour.

## Ethical Considerations
Web scraping should be done ethically and responsibly. It's important to respect the website's terms and conditions and not to overload the website with requests. Additionally, the data collected should not be used for illegal purposes or shared without permission.

## Best Practices
When web scraping, it's recommended to continuously parse and verify the extracted data. If you're extracting data from well-protected websites or scraping multiple web pages, it's recommended to use a proxy server with your web scraper. There are numerous open-source and low/no-code pre-built web scrapers available that can be used for this purpose.
